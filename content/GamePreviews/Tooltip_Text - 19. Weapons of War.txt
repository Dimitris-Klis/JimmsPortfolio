Weapons of War
<br />
Made this for the 16<sup>th</sup> pirate software Game Jam.
<br />
<br />
This game was originally meant to be based on Cannon Fodder, an old amiga game. Weapons of War was meant
to have multiple levels, vehicles, enemy turrets, and a couple unique enemies.
<br />
<br />
A lot of stuff got in the way though, so I ended up with a buggy score-based game. At least it's fun.
Worst of all, I didn't finish in time, so I got disqualified. The judges were kind enough to
leave feedback though!
