Typeytext:
<br />
Typeytext is a game where you type the words on the screen, kind of like <a href="https://monkeytype.com/" target="_blank">monkeytype</a>.
Since it's such a simple concept, I was able to polish it <i>a lot</i>.
<br />
<br />
I decided to make this simple game to help boost morale, since I've failed:
<ol>
	<li>The 15th Pirate Software Game Jam</li>
	<li>The GMTK Game Jam of 2024</li>
	<li>A big project I was working on</li>
</ol>

I've also made some nice sounds & music for the game.
<br />
<br />
This project took me about 2 days to make. It's not my most creative work but I'm proud of it nonetheless.
