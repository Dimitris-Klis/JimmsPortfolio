V-Cam:
<br />
2 years after Framecam's release, I decided to make an entirely new project called V-Cam.
This time, almost no bugs are present and it's easier to use.
<br />
<br />
This project took me about 1 and a half days to make, which was pretty quick.
<br />
<br />
Despite better free programs being out there, I wanted to make my own simplified version.
<br />
<br />
Something I've discovered when making this program is that Unity has very bad Microphone implementation.
