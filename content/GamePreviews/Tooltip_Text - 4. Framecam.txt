Framecam:
<br />
Framecam was made to test whether I could make a program that changes images according to the microphone volume.
So basically, a simplified VTuber program.

<br />
I did manage to get it to work, but I believe that it's no longer functional.
Maybe version 1.0 still is. This is an incredibly buggy program.

<br />
Funnily enough, I found a way better free program that does exactly this in September of 2023,
though I am no longer interested.
