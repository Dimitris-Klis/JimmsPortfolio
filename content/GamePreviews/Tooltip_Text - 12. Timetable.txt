School Timetable:<br />
The School Timetable Program began development during the final year of Middle School.
<br />
<br />
At first, there was only an android version that existed only on my phone. Its features included: making timetables,
editing their cells, saving, loading and copying/pasting boards. It also displayed in how much time the next lesson or break would begin.
<br />
<br />
School start times, lesson lengths & break lengths were all hardcoded. The only language was Greek.
<br />
<br />
During the second semester, more features were added, like keeping track of lost lessons and note writing.
<br />
<br />
This program has been finalized, localized and uploaded to itch.io for Windows & Android during the beginning of the first year of High School.
