Pillow Battle!:
<br>
This game started as an idea in my coding notebook; A first person shooter battle royale game with the twist of everything being sleep related.
<br>
<br>
I used the free version of photon for this game, so Battle Royale was not an option. I was forced to make this a team deathmatch game.
<br>
<br>
This is my first and only online game so far. Photon is an incredible free online package, but it's complicated (since online play is also complicated)
and it was quite painful for me to finish this game.
This is a cool game to play with friends, but no one plays it unfortunately.
<br>
<br>
 It's also not very polished. I would put it on the 'Buggy Messes' area, but
it's one of my favourite personal projects as I definetely had fun while making it.
