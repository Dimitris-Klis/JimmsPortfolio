Mini Golf Dungeon:
<br />
A pretty fun and polished game. I don't remember when I had the idea of making it.
Was finished for a long time but I only uploaded it to itch.io after the release of "Boat Duty!".
<br />
<br />
The level is procedurally generated. Different rooms & different obstacles every single time. There is no end goal, apart from getting the golf ball in the hole.
<br />
<br />
There are also time based & stroke based scores. In April 6th, 2024 I randomly decided to fix the few bugs the game had and released v1.1. 
<br />
<br />
You can find the patch notes in the game's store page.
