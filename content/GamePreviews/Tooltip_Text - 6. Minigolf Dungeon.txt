Mini Golf Dungeon:
<br />
A pretty fun and polished game. I don't remember when I had the idea of making it.
Was finished for a long time but I only uploaded it to itch.io after the release of "Boat Duty!".
<br />
<br />
The level is procedurally generated. Different rooms & different obstacles every single time. There is no end goal, apart from getting the golf ball in the hole.
<br />
<br />
There are also time based & stroke based scores. There is one bug in this game: The minimap displays blocked off entries to rooms.
