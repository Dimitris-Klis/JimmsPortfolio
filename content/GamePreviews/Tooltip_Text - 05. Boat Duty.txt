Boat Duty:
<br />
Boat Duty was made during the 2nd year of Middle School, for a Pancypriot competition called
"Logipaignio" and "Game Development Challenge", which lasted for about half a year.
My computer science teacher was the one who found the competition. This competition was split into 3 age groups:
Middle School Students, High School Students & University Students.
<br />
<br />
Due to the competition requiring a team, I was assigned with 4 other students from my school.
The theme was very vague: water. We all quickly came up with the idea of a boat that rides around a polluted lake.
Your goal was to use the trash in said lake to make 3 things: A Radio Tower, a TV Station & some letters.
<br />
<br />
I was the person who did most of the work, since the others didn't know much about programming or music production.
However, one of four teammates was extremely helpful during the final day before the submission of the project.
He made the final 3D models for the game. I managed to make my first inventory system with this game, although it's not the best.
<br />
<br />
Despite a lot of procrastination, and a couple of serious bugs, we managed to make it to Phase 2. We quickly found out why:
The majority of the contestants that made it to phase 2 made some pretty simple games which lacked polish. A reminder that these were the contestants who made it to phase 2.
Our game was so good in comparison, that it could compete with the other age groups.
<br />
<br />
Because such talent is rare in Cyprus, the judges doubted our abilities and we were placed third, 
right under a badly made scratch game.
Even if I can't fight age discrimination, I'd really want to go again, though the competion has been gone since 2022.
