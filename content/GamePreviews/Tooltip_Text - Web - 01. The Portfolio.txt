The Portfolio:<br />
Decided to document the portfolio itself in my portfolio.
<br />
<br />
On the 22nd of October 2023, I decided to make a nice looking portfolio. I'd made one in the past, but it was pretty mediocre, so I wanted to go again.
<br />
<br />
Since then, many changes and additions have been made (More games, different colors, different navigation bar, etc.)

<br />
<br />
During the beginning of this site's lifespan, in the projects section every single image/description
had to be added manually in the html file, resulting in an overwhelming wall of text.
<br />
<br />
I decided to use javascript to help me deal with this issue.
Now, every project only needs 3 things:
<ul>
	<li>A png file (project image)</li>
	<li>A txt file (project description)</li>
	<li>A single line of code in javascript which adds the project to the html file.</li>
</ul>
Finally, on September of 2024, by adding a couple lines of code to the javascript file,
I made the tooltips position themselves dynamically to the left/right of the project (They were originally hardcoded as left or right tooltips).
