My Achievement System:<br />
I got inspired by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a>'s achievement popup and decided to make an entire achievement system.
<br />
<br />
This is going to be especially useful if I ever manage to release a game with a slightly bigger scope than usual.
