Seven Nights At Boomclub (SNAB):
<br />
SNAB is a Five Nights at Freddy's fan game, that I made to test my skills in developing a somewhat scary and stressful environment.
<br />
<br />
I would say that I've also succeeded in developing unique mechanics for the game, which is great since I tend to struggle when coming up with ideas.
<br />
<br />
This idea started in my coding notebook and was brought to life with Unity. It was published to Game Jolt, since that's where fan games usually go.
