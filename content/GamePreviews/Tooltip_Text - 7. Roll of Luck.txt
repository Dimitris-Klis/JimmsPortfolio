A Roll Of Luck:
<br />
This game is a submission for the Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam 2022.
<br />
<br />
Originally meant to be a board game, that idea was quickly scrapped during the final day,
and it quickly became a top down shooter.
The unique mechanic here is:
every time you collect ammo, you get a random gun.
<br />
<br />
A Roll Of Luck was submitted 14 minutes before the end of the jam.
The menu was made 1 or 2 weeks ago to save time.
The music was made by me months ago and I repurposed it for the game.
