Conventional Combat... NOT!:
<br />
This game started production 5 days after the Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam of 2021.
It is a submission for the Mashup Game Jam 2.
<br />
<br />
You have a saw attached to your player, which is a unique way of attacking enemies.
This game is quite fun, but there are some bugs that ruin the gameplay.
<br />
<br />
You can't die when your health drops to 0, and the shooting enemies are very buggy.
