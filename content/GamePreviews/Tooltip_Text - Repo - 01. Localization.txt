My Localization System:<br />
I made this to prove to myself that I can make stuff without the use of AI.
<br />
<br />
Before this, I had used <a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> to make a localization script for a game I was working on. I continued using ChatGPT for 2 years until
I decided to ditch it altogether for 3 reasons:
<ol>
	<li>It takes the same amount of time to write the code myself.</li>
	<li>Forcing AI to solve your problems = not learning new stuff (usually)</li>
	<li>AI dramatically increased my Impostor Syndrome</li>
</ol>
And to prove that I don't need it, I made this new and improved localization system.
It's a project I'm truly proud of since 100% of it is made by me.
