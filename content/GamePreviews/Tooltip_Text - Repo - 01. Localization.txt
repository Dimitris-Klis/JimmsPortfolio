My Localization System:<br />
I made this to prove to myself that I am capable of creating stuff without relying too much on tools like <a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>, 
or other people's work.
<br />
<br />
In the past, I used ChatGPT to create a localization script for a game I was working on. It worked ok but I had a couple issues with it:
<ol>
	<li>The script had a couple of bugs.</li>
	<li>I didn't fully understand what the code was doing.</li>
	<li>I doubted my own abilities as a programmer, since I relied on an external source to create the script.</li>
</ol>
After struggling with self-doubt for a while, I decided to challenge myself by creating this specific script again from scratch, without using external resources.
<br/>
As a result:
<ol>
	<li>The code was clearer and easier to understand.</li>
	<li>The script made localization much easier than the previous script.</li>
	<li>I didn't feel self-doubt anymore.</li>
</ol>
Despite this being just a few simple scripts, it's a project I'm really proud of.
