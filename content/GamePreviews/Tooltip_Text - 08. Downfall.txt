Downfall:
<br />
Downfall is a small "horror" game made in 1 week and submitted to the Brackeys Game Jam 2022.2.
<br />
<br />
There are 10 levels in total & an introductory cutscene. Some levels have some simple puzzles.
<br />
<br />
Overall, with a little more work, this game could get really interesting. I don't have the motivation
to continue it, however.
