Flashpacked:
<br />
Flashpacked is a simple tool, meant for helping people study more efficiently.
<br />
<br />
I made this tool because I wanted to try out new ways of memorizing for tests, but was dissatisfied by the current market of flashcard applications. So, I made my own!

<br />
<br />
This project took about a week with many breaks, due to schoolwork and slight burnout.
