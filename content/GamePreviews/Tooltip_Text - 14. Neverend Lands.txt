Neverend Lands:<br />
I made this for the pirate software game jam, though I started working on it before that.
In this game, your goal is to beat 3 neverend events: Nights of infinite length where a few waves of enemies will spawn.

<br />
I did all the music, sounds, UI and programming by myself, 
apart from the noises you hear in the background during the day and night.

Before this game, I made
a new Inventory System and released it to <a href="https://github.com/Dimitris-Klis/UnityInventoryPack" target="_blank">github.com</a>.
It's a huge improvement in comparison to my first inventory system introduced in Boat Duty.
I used that for the game, after fixing a couple bugs that slipped in.
I also used a pathfinding algorithm for the enemies made by <a href="https://github.com/LostTrainDude/astar-pathfinding-unity">LostTrainDude</a>
<br />
<br />
I even made a couple devlogs for the game and the first one got 200+ views!
<br />
<br />
This is one of my biggest projects yet, due to the complex mechanics I added, like building, destroying, and storing items.
Another challenge was creating a game design document for the game 2 hours before the end of the jam. Keep in mind that Jam
ended at 4AM EEST. The last time I had to pull an all nighter like this was with 'Boat Duty'.
