A Sawing Connection:
<br />
My first attempt at a 2 day game jam. This was a submission for the Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam of 2021.
<br />
<br />
The theme was chained together, so I made a player with a mace attached to them. Your goal is to reach the end.
I also had a simple form of adaptive music.
<br />
<br />
The only problem is: The level design sucks. Also, performance affects
the physics, so the slower the computer, the less likely you are to win.
<br />
<br />
The menu is horribly rushed.
