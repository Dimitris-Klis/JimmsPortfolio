SNAB Remastered:<br />
After a failed attempt at remastering the original project, I decided to start anew. The mechanics ended up quite polished and the audio is much nicer.
<br />
<br />
I did all the music, sounds, UI, 3D models and programming by myself. I even voiced the voicelines.
<br />
<br />
I also playtested the game with a couple friends. I wanted to ensure that almost no bugs would be present in the final release.

<br />
<br />
I made a devlog for the game but it didn't really gain an audience.
<br />
<br />
This is one of my most polished games. I am very happy with the results so I hope people actually find it.
