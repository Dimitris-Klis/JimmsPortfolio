Subscription UI Editor:<br />
I've obtained some work experience at <a href="https://www.machapp.net/">MACHAPP Sotftware</a>, a mobile application company.
<br />
<br />
At MACHAPP I made a simple UI Editor program which enabled them to modify the subscription page of a 
weather application they published.
<br />
<br />
Any changes made to the UI are shown to you in realtime. 
You can also import and export your changes as a .json for use in the actual app.

Thanks to this job, I've learned how to use <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> and <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">Sourcetree</a>.
<br />
<br />
In general, I've learned the basics of version control and git repositories, important aspects of software development 
if you want to work in a team or quickly revert to previous versions of your project.
<br />
<br />
I've also obtained experience in winforms 
<br />
(which was what I used to make the program).
